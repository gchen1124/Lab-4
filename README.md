Affordable Housing Dashboard
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the relationship between the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) dataset and housing data using Tableau. The goal is to explore patterns, insights, and correlations between various social vulnerability factors and housing-related attributes.
Objectives
Analyze Social Vulnerability and Housing Data:
Understand the demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics across different regions.
Identify Key Insights:
Highlight relationships between SVI metrics (e.g., unemployment, poverty, age distribution) and housing factors (e.g., total affordable units, zoning).

Present Findings:
Provide a clear, interactive, and visually appealing dashboard for decision-makers and stakeholders.
Datasets Used
Social Vulnerability Index (SVI):
Contains metrics related to population demographics, economic conditions, housing burden, and vulnerability indicators.
Key Columns:
TRACT, E_TOTPOP, E_POV150, E_UNEMP, E_HBURD, E_AGE65, E_AGE17, etc.
Housing Data:
Includes details about housing projects, zoning, and population characteristics.
Key Columns:
ADDRESS, TOTAL_AFFO, ZONING, ZONE_DESCR, E_TOTPOP, E_POV150, E_UNEMP, etc.
Tableau Dashboard Components

Filters:
Region/Location filter to narrow down data based on specific areas.
Year or zoning-related filters to analyze trends over time or by zoning types.
Charts and Visualizations:
Demographic Overview: Display population statistics (e.g., age distribution, minority percentage).
Housing Affordability Analysis: Compare total affordable housing units against social vulnerability metrics.
Key Correlations: Scatterplots and heatmaps showing relationships between E_POV150 (poverty), E_UNEMP (unemployment), and housing factors.

Maps:
Geographic representation of SVI and housing data, showcasing high-risk areas and housing availability.
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
Top metrics highlighting the most vulnerable areas and housing gaps.
